HW0 for CS 241f21

Contents:

sortable.py
sortableNat.py
sortableSet.py
autograder.py

Instructions:

For HW0, you will implement two classes, SortableNat and SortableSet.
These classes inherit methods from the Sortable class in sortable.py and apply the methods to the cases of natural numbers or sets, respectively.

1. Study sortable.py to become familiar with the methods common to the Sortable class. You may also wish to read comments in sortableNat.py and sortableSet.py
2. Implement all relevant methods in the inherited class SortableNat, which is a class containing a natural number
3. Implement all relevant methods in the inherited class SortableSet, which is a class containing a Python set and a method for sorting these sets
4. Run autograder.py, which will perform some testing over sortable.py, sortableNat.py, and sortableSet.py
5. Submit your sortableNat.py and sortableSet.py for feedback*

* The process for feedback is not yet determined.

Learning objectives:

Familiarity with using Python fields (including booleans, integers, and sets).
Familiarity with Python classes (including inheritance and public and private fields and methods).
Familiarity with system for providing feedback.

Helpful hint:

There are many ways to get code from GitHub to your computer. Consider viewing individual files and using copy/paste, cloning this repository, or download a snapshot of as a .zip!
